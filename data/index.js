The political, economic, and cultural events of the time had a significant impact on both foreign missionaries and Chinese Christians.

While the Chinese Communist Party was hostile to religion in general, it did not seek to systematically destroy religion as long as the religious organizations were willing to submit to the direction of the Chinese state. Many Protestants were willing to accept such accommodation and were permitted to continue religious life in China under the name (Three-Self Patriotic Movement). Catholics, on the other hand, with their allegiance to the Holy See, could not submit to the Chinese state as their Protestant counterparts did. Consequently, the Chinese state organized the Catholic Patriotic Church that operates without connection to the Vatican, and the Catholics who continued to acknowledge the authority of the Pope were subject to persecution. From 1966 to 1976 during the Cultural Revolution, the expression of religious life in China was effectively banned, including even the Three-Self Church. Religions in China began to recover after the economic reforms of the 1970s. In 1979 the government officially restored the Three-Self Church after thirteen years of non-existence, and in 1980 the China Christian Council (CCC) was formed.", ""],

These ideas solidified Chinese elites' identification with colonized people and the "East." The Ottoman Empire was cited as an example of an Asian power that had fallen victim to Western intrusions. Chinese media referred to Islamic empires as "huihui guo," meaning "Islamic state," stressing spiritual affinity over territorial boundaries. This was the same term used for centuries to refer to China's own Muslims. Hui imam Wang Haoran traveled to Mecca, Cairo, and Istanbul in 1905-1907 and appealed to the Ottoman ruler for aid on behalf of Chinese Muslims. Moreover, The video above tells the story of how Islam thrived in Xinjiang`,
        `The First World War and the rise of mass politics led to more assertive expressions of Sino-Islamic fraternity in print media. The term "huijiao guo" began to appear in Chinese print media, referring to Muslim countries either individually or collectively. In 1919, the term "huijiao zhi shijie" or "huijiao shijie" (Islamic world) also appeared. Hui elites played a leading role in bringing knowledge of the Islamic world to China. The concept of the Islamic world continued to evolve in the Chinese media throughout the 20th century.`,
         `After the fall of the Ottoman Empire in 1919, the concept of the Islamic world (huijiao zhi shijie or huijiao shijie) emerged in Chinese media. This new, multipolar concept of Islamic community above the nation state was promoted by Hui elites who had traveled to Mecca and other Islamic countries. By 1930, three of the "Four Great Imams" celebrated for modernizing Chinese Islam had made the hajj to Mecca and brought back new knowledge, language skills, and connections. This helped shape another Chinese conception of Islam in concert with Muslims elsewhere. Sun Yat-sen recognized the potential of these connections in 1912, and opportunities for their use arose when the Guomindang came to power in 1927.`],
